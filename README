This is a library for dealing with Apple Macintosh files on Unix systems.

There are four different layers currently implemented.

At the lowest level are ff-macbinary.c, ff-applesingledouble.c and
ff-hexbin.c.  These give interfaces to the common formats used for
storing Macintosh files on non-Macintosh computers - MacBinary,
MacBinary II, MacBinary III, Apple Single Apple Double, and HexBin.

'Beside' that level is the resource.c level.  Given a memory buffer that
contains a Macintosh resource file, it allows retreiving resource data
by (type,id) pairs.  No interpretation of the data is done.

Above both of those is the applefile.[ch] level.  This gives a unified
(but currently less-featureful) interface to MacBinary, AppleSingle and
AppleDouble files, handles finding the resource file inside the file,
and exports the af_res and af_data functions.

On top of all of that are resource-type specific interfaces; currently
the only one is xpm_data(), which return the XPM-format data
corresponding to an icon with a given ID.  (This has actually been
moved to the sample-apps directory; I'm undecided how things like this
should be handled)

libapplefile is licensed under the GPL.  See COPYING for more information.
