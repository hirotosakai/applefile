	* configure.ac: modernize configure.in to avoid autoconf error
	* AUTHORS, INSTALL, NEWS: add to avoid automake error
	* graphics.c: add #inclde <string.h>
	* resource.c: add #inclde <string.h>
	* rt-cicn.c: add #inclde <string.h>
	* rt-ppat.c: add #inclde <string.h>

2000-03-05  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* configure.in: updated VERSION to 0.3

	* Makefile.am (libapplefile_la_LDFLAGS): updated CURRENT to 1

	* sample-apps/dumpall.c: changes to write direct pixmaps as PNG
	files, to support the 32bit icon types

	* rt-ppat.c (af_ppat_to_indexed_pixmap): don't try to process
	32-bit ppats (I didn't know there were such a thing!  none of the
	documentation I've found mentions them.  need to investigate this)

	* rt-icons.c (get_icns): new function for parsing an icns resource 
	and returning a table of pointers to the subresources
	(icns_make_indexed): new function for building an
	af_indexed_pixmap_t from a pre-parsed icns
	(icns_decompress): new function for decompressing an icns 32bit plane
	(icns_make_direct): new function for building an
	af_direct_pixmap_t from a pre-parsed icns
	(get_indexed_icns): old implementation split into get_icns and
	icns_make_indexed; converted to use those
	(get_direct_icns): new function for getting a direct pixmap from
	an icns, or getting an indexed one and converting, as necessary
	(af_get_direct_icon): first implementation

	* af-graphics.h: af_get_direct_icon doesn't have a colors
	argument, but does have a mode argument indicating which
	(sub)resources to use to satisfy the request

2000-03-02  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* sample-apps/dumpall.c (save_indexed_pmap): support 'type's
	longer than 4 characters (for icns + subtype)
	(dump_icns): initial implementation; dumps all the indexed icns
	subtypes, but not yet the 32 bit formats
	(dumptype): pass a NUL-terminated version of the type string to
	the dump functions, to more easily allow string manipulation there 
	if wanted

	* rt-ppat.c (af_ppat_to_indexed_pixmap): use af_int_map_indexed()

	* rt-icons.c (trad_indexed): use af_int_map_indexed()
	(get_indexed_icns): initial implementation - handles all the
	indexed palette parts of the icns
	(ICON_indexed): initial implementation
	(af_get_indexed_icon): if try_icns == 2, *only* try icns; mainly
	for debugging/sample app usage - nearly all real uses should use
	try_icns == 1
	(struct depths): simplified struct, removing items no longer
	needed here with move to af_int_map_indexed()

	* rt-cicn.c (af_cicn_to_indexed_pixmap): use af_int_pmap_indexed()

	* graphics.c (af_int_pmap_indexed): new function, combined
	generalization of several old ones

	* af-graphics.h: af_get_indexed_icon's try_icns parm is now a
	tristate, documented in a comment;  new internal-only function
	af_int_pmap_indexed for the common code for converting from
	apples' 3 gazillion slightly-different pmap formats to the
	canonical indexed pixmap format

2000-03-01  Todd Larason  <jtl@molehill.org>

	* af-graphics.h: add af_get_indexed_icon() and af_get_direct_icon()

	* Makefile.am (libapplefile_la_SOURCES): add rt-icons.c
